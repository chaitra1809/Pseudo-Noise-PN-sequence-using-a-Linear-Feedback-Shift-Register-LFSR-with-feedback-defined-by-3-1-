# Pseudo-Noise-PN-sequence-using-a-Linear-Feedback-Shift-Register-LFSR-with-feedback-defined-by-3-1-
The sequence is generated using a fixed algorithm, ensuring repeatability for a given initial state.  For an n-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), the length of a PN sequence is 2^nâˆ’1, which  is the maximal length achievable for n bits. The sequence does not include an all-zero state.
